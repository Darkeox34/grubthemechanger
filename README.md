# GRUB Theme Manager

A simple Python script to manage and apply GRUB themes on Linux systems. This tool allows you to easily switch between installed GRUB themes with an interactive command-line interface.

## Features

- üé® Interactive theme selection menu
- üîí Automatic backup of GRUB configuration
- ‚úÖ Safe theme application with error handling
- üõ°Ô∏è Superuser privilege checking
- üìÅ Automatic GRUB configuration regeneration

## Requirements

- Linux system with GRUB bootloader
- Python 3.x
- Superuser (root) privileges
- GRUB themes installed in `/boot/grub/themes/`

## Installation

1. Clone this repository or download the script:
```bash
git clone <your-repository-url>
cd grub-theme-manager
```

2. Make the script executable:
```bash
chmod +x grub_theme_manager.py
```

## Usage

Run the script with superuser privileges:

```bash
sudo python3 grub_theme_manager.py
```

The script will:
1. Check for superuser privileges
2. Display all available themes in `/boot/grub/themes/`
3. Allow you to select a theme interactively
4. Create a backup of your current GRUB configuration
5. Apply the selected theme
6. Regenerate the GRUB configuration

### Example Output

```
Available themes: 
(1) breeze
(2) ubuntu-mate
(3) stylish
Please select the theme you want to use: 
2
You have selected the theme ubuntu-mate, do you want to apply this theme? (y/n)

Creating a backup copy of grub config!
Backup directory created at /path/to/script/backup
Backup of grub config created at /path/to/script/backup/grub
Theme ubuntu-mate applied successfully!
grub-mkconfig executed successfully!
```

## How It Works

### Directory Structure

The script expects GRUB themes to be installed in the following structure:
```
/boot/grub/themes/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ theme1/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ theme.txt
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ theme2/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ theme.txt
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ theme3/
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ theme.txt
```

### Backup System

Before making any changes, the script automatically creates a backup of your GRUB configuration:
- Backup location: `./backup/grub` (relative to script location)
- The backup directory is created automatically if it doesn't exist

### Configuration Process

1. **Backup**: Creates a safety backup of `/etc/default/grub`
2. **Modify**: Updates the `GRUB_THEME` line in the configuration
3. **Apply**: Runs `grub-mkconfig` to regenerate the GRUB configuration file

## Safety Features

- **Privilege Check**: Ensures the script is run with sudo
- **File Validation**: Verifies theme files exist before applying
- **Backup Creation**: Automatically backs up configuration before changes
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error checking and user feedback
- **Input Validation**: Validates user input for theme selection

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"This script requires superuser privileges"**
- Solution: Run the script with `sudo`

**"Path /boot/grub/themes/ doesn't exist"**
- Solution: Install GRUB themes first, or check if GRUB is properly installed

**"theme.txt does not exist"**
- Solution: Ensure the selected theme has a proper `theme.txt` file

**"Error executing grub-mkconfig"**
- Solution: Check if GRUB is properly configured and you have write permissions

### Restoring from Backup

If something goes wrong, you can restore your original GRUB configuration:

```bash
sudo cp ./backup/grub /etc/default/grub
sudo grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg
```

## Installing GRUB Themes

To install new GRUB themes:

1. Download a GRUB theme
2. Extract it to `/boot/grub/themes/`
3. Ensure it contains a `theme.txt` file
4. Run this script to apply it

Example:
```bash
sudo mkdir -p /boot/grub/themes/mytheme
sudo cp -r downloaded-theme/* /boot/grub/themes/mytheme/
sudo python3 grub_theme_manager.py
```
